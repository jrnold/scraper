I created a Digital Ocean server running mongo 3.2.7 on Ubuntu 14.04.

I installed git and cloned `jrnold/scraper`:
```console
$ apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/jrnold/scraper.git
$ cd scraper
$ git checkout kenya
```

I copied the config file, but did not edit any settings
```console
$ cp default_config.ini config.ini
```

It would be more clean to use a virtualenv but this is all I'm running on this
server, and installing via pip requires external libraries and building some
parts of the package from source.
I also removed the version specific info from `requirements.txt`.
```console
$ apt-get install python-lxml python-pil python-yaml \
  python-pymongo python-beautifulsoup python-nltk
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run this daily, I used `crontab` instead of the `scraper_schedule.py`.
I added the following line to the `crontab`:
```
@daily python cd /root/scraper && /root/scraper/scraper.py
```
